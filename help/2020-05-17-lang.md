    If you choose another language while reading an article, it will switch you between articles (as intended), not to the index page. If an article on the selected language is not exist, only in this case you will be redirected to the root page of English version: http://santa-agata.com/en/.
    All English articles will have the /en/ postfix after the blog address. The activity in the English "branch" is expected to be average or even lower, so I decided to use only categories - it should be enough to search any existing articles.
